<!--
  popup.html
  -------------------------------
  This is the main popup interface for the Xbuster extension.

  Purpose:
  - Helps users stay focused online by reducing distracting content.
  - Provides quick-access controls (enable/disable, settings, status).
  - Interacts with background.js and contentScript.js when needed.

  Notes:
  - Keep the UI lightweight so the popup loads instantly.
  - Any scripts should be imported using Chrome Extension Manifest V3 rules.
  - Do not use inline JavaScript or inline event handlers (for security).
